## Please apply the machine learning algorithm you built to each of the
## 20 test cases in the testing data set. For more information and
## instructions on how to build your model see the prediction assignment
## writeup. For each test case you should submit a text file with a
## single capital letter (A, B, C, D, or E) corresponding to your
## prediction for the corresponding problem in the test data set. You get
## 1 point for each correct answer. You may submit up to 2 times for each
## problem. I know it is a lot of files to submit. It may be helpful to
## use the following function to create the files. If you have a
## character vector with your 20 predictions in order for the 20
## problems. So something like (note these are not the right answers!):

pml_testing <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv",header = T)
pml_training <- read.csv("pml-training.csv", header = T)
